Hi!, Iâ€™m Arpit. Welcome to my personal website. I am a currently a Product Engineer at [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), where youâ€™ll find me either ~~yelling~~ cursing at my computer when my code won't work or laying back in my chair and relishing my brief moments of glory when it does.

Apart from coding to earn the daily bread, sometimes I code for [fun](https://github.com/arpitbatra123) as well and write about things I observe around me.  In my free time, I like to read [books](https://goodreads.com/arpitbatra123), watch tv shows/movies and click [photos](https://unsplash.com/@arpitbatra123/).

This website/blog is my effort at organizing my thoughts and giving them a creative outlet. Happy reading. ðŸ˜„
