How you doin?

I'm a Product Engineer at [postman](https://www.postman.com/) where youâ€™ll find me either ~~yelling~~ cursing at my computer when my code won't work or laying back in my chair and relishing my brief moments of glory when it does.

Previously, I was a volunteer intern at a non-profit org, [lokarpan](https://lokarpan.org/about-interns.html) where I worked on internal tooling.

I take photos on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@arpitbatra123/), review books on [komura](/komura), log the movies i watch on [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/arpitbatra123/films/) and do open-source stuff on [github](https://github.com/arpitbatra123).

This website is my effort at organizing my thoughts and giving them a creative outlet. Happy reading!
