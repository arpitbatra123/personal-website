This book, as the author says himself is a collection of succinct ideas. These ideas can be applied to various facets of life	and depend on how you interpret them. The things written in this book might linger on at the back of your mind, as you retrospect and realign your thought processes. This is the kind of book that warrants a reread from time to time, and I am planning to do the same.

Listen down below, are my highlights for this book:

ART IS USELESS, AND SO AM I
	
> Art is useless by definition. If it was useful, it would be a tool.

I’M A VERY SLOW THINKER

> People say that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.

DISCONNECT

> You get no competitive edge from consuming the same stuff everyone else is consuming. It’s rare, now, to focus. And it gives such better rewards.

DON’T BE A DONKEY

> Most people overestimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years.

OK MILT, I’LL START WRITING AGAIN

> Time spent doing one thing is time spent not doing something else.

MOVING FOR GOOD

> You really learn only when you’re surprised. If you’re not surprised, then everything is fitting into your existing thought patterns. So to get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives.
