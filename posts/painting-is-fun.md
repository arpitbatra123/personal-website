After trying out [sketching](/posts/i-drew-totoro/) earlier, I was looking for something else to try so I tried to dabble my hand at watercolor painting.

So, on a Sunday evening, I went on youtube and searched for "Beginner Painting" when this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5tGiseJAGY) gathered my attention. Landscapes and Nature are always fascinating and on seeing the video, it looked like something a beginner like me could do. So I got watercolors and a piece of paper and just went through with it. 

This is how the painting looked in the video:

And this is my first attempt at the painting:

I was not very patient while drawing the painting for the first so it did not turn up as good as I wanted it to. Therefore I decided to have another go at it. This is my second attempt:

This time it was significantly better. The colors could be a little brighter but that's a lesson for the future.

By the way, if you are fond of art, [Loving Vincent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_Vincent) is a great film!
