## Review

This is a very interesting book, and you feel like you're a part of the story the author is narrating. I am intrigued about the idea of remote work for a very long time, and if remote work is executed like Automattic has been doing in the last decade, it really can become the future of work.

I was impressed with the caliber demonstrated by the author while being a manager at Automattic, and the book is full of wonderful lessons that can be applied in your personal/professional life.

As the book draws to a close, the author talks about how work in the modern era might not be psychologically fulfilling and a better work culture might solve this. This struck a chord with me, as I'm more than often concerned with the "meaning" of work but as the author says, work and play might not need to be mutually exclusive.

Chapter 10: How to Start a Fire
