here i stand, on the moonlit rooftop 
watching the clouds pass me by

there’s your silhouette, a thousand rooftops away,
you’re walking under the starry sky

i remember the time i held your hand,
unaware of what time had planned

you came to me like rays of the rising sun,
but departed like the ocean escapes the sand

here i lie beside the window,
staring at the ceiling high

there you are, in the shadows,
the fireflies bid you goodbye
