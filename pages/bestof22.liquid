The book was originally in English, and I read the Hindi translation.

              <h3>The Travelling Cat Chronicles
              </h3>
              <p>I picked up this book from a bookstore in Pokhra, Nepal. I am fond of Japanese literature/culture and when I saw a cat on the cover and in the book title, I bought it instantly. This is a lovely book, sometimes narrated in 3rd person, and most often from the perspective of Nana, a street cat who's rescued and taken in by our human protagonist, Satoru. We follow along Satoru and Nana's journey through Japan, as they look for a suitable person to adopt Nana as Satoru can no longer keep him. ( Read the book to find out why! ) I was delightfully smiling through the beautiful narration from Nana's perspective. All of the other supporting characters are very well written, and since there aren't many of them, we remember every character as the story goes by. The author has asserted a lot of importance of demonstrating the relationship of the other characters with Satoru, and how they've been involved in Satoru's life in the past.
                Nana, the street cat is of course the hero of the story, and the character is very well written. He is a lovely little cat and reminds me of the mannerisms of the cat in the movie Kiki's Delivery Service. Reading about the various landscapes of Japan, Mount Fuji, the ocean, etc. from the perspective of Nana often left me smiling and wondering.

Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
